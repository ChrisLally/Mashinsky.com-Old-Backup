      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Mashinsky">Alex Mashinsky</a> was born into communism, reared

        over the years,
        including <a href="http://www.celsius.network/">Celsius Network</a>,

        people worldwide
        to use free voice over the internet for free. His new startup Celsius Network, is disrupting the banks, it is a
        community-based Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol allowing members to borrow dollars against their crypto
        assets and
        to earn interest when they deposit (and lend) their crypto out. he wants 7.5B people to go
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Z543pFBJq4c?t">From VOIP to MOIP</a> (Money over IP)</p>

      <p>Alex's success as an entrepreneur stems from his acute ability to identify future trends, assemble world-class
        teams and
        raise enough money to fund his projects. Two of his companies, Arbinet and Transit Wireless achieved a
        monopolistic hold in
        their respective industries and pioneered new business models and groundbreaking technologies.</p>

        and many other top performing web companies. He is one of the leading evangelists of web-based exchanges.</p>

      <p>Due to his extensive experience as a prolific inventor and a business strategist, Alex has been a featured
        speaker at over
        250 international conferences. He has also made numerous TV appearances on
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=32&amp;v=Z-quhLTcNt4">business networks</a> and talk shows.</p>

      <p>He has received numerous awards, notably the prestigious Albert Einstein Technology Medal in 2000, the
        Technology Foresight Award
        for Innovation (presented in Geneva at Telecom '99) and Crain's Top Entrepreneur Award in 2010. He has also
        been nominated for
        E&amp;Y's Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2002 and 2011.</p>

      <p>After years of entrepreneurship, Alex subsequently gravitated towards investing in startups, founding his
        early stage venture
        capital firm, Governing Dynamics. Over the years, Alex has raised over $1 billion in venture and private equity
        funds to help
        position his startups as leaders in their fields. Arbinet's fundraising efforts were even documented in an HBS
        case study in 2001.</p>

      <p>Currently based in New York, Alex serves as a Managing Partner of Governing Dynamics. The firm has invested in
        Cryptocurencies and
        ICO's as well as startups focused on AI/ML, biotech and cybersecurity.</p>

      <p>Alex has invested in over <a href="https://angel.co/mashinsky">60 startups</a> over the years, recording many
        successes
        and an equal number of failures. As a prominent figure in the New York entrepreneurial scene, he has previously
        been a
        member of the YPO's NYC chamber. He believes that "the secret to success is finding something to do in which
        your skills can exceed your ambitions."</p>

            Why AGFA will be worth $4T in the next 10 years</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon (AGFA) are the 4 horseman of the Web 2.0 wave. We love the founders,
              their products and most of us would love to work in any of these companies. These companies are now worth
              $800b in aggregate and are growing their revenues more than 40% a year.</p>
            <p>The AGFA group is creating the most value in the tech sector and I argue that they will continue to do
              so because they all represent the Best 3 P's - Product, Platform, Protocol.</p>
            <p>Each one of these companies has managed to carve out a large segment of the digital lifestyle of the
              future. Hundreds of thousand's of partners have tied their future to each one of these platforms and they
              all use the API protocols published by these companies to enable e-commerce in hundreds of billions of
              dollars.</p>
            <p>The surprising fact is that none of these companies has yet captured more than 25% of the market share
              in their core segment and thus still have plenty of growth ahead of them.</p>

            The "Startup Cambrian Explosion"</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p><a href="../images/chart-of-the-day-tech-valuations-june-2011.gif"><img style="margin: 0 0 0 5px; float: right" src="../images/chart-of-the-day-tech-valuations-june-2011-small.gif" width="200" height="191" alt=""></a>
              In 2011 the overall investments by Angels have for the first time exceeded the total investments by A
              round venture funds, the "Startup Cambrian Explosion" driven by a combination of hype from Facebook,
              Twitter and other successful startups combined with the highest unemployment in the 18-35 year old
              professional in 70 years and glut of Angel money chasing the next big exit has resulted in thousands of
              new startups being launched nationwide.</p>
            <p>With the explosion of cheap cloud based services and API infrastructure of hundreds of Web 2.0 platform
              companies it now costs less than $100,000 to launch a full beta service on the web or a mobile platform,
              thus the barriers to a product launch have been cut by 90% from where they were 10 years ago.</p>
            <p>Many of these services have managed to get over 1,000,000 users in less than 12 month with NO marketing,
              relying entirely on their social network and the extended social graph to create a chain reaction of
              subscription and adoption which in turn drives free but valuable feedback which drives iteration and
              improvement of the service. The best startups of the past 5 years have emerged successfully scaling this
              model.</p>
            <p>These young companies still need capital and so an ecosystem of angel investors have sprung up in all
              major cities to take pieces of such companies and bet on their future. All such investors hope to be part
              of the 3:30:300 explosion which came to symbolize the level of valuations startups can expect if they can
              deliver the hockey stick growth Venture capitalists are looking for at the Seed, A and B rounds.</p>
            <p>The unseen and devastating part of this explosion is the inevitable death of the vast majority of these
              startups as they try to leap from the seed stage to the A round safety of Venture funding. Like the
              gazelles trying to cross the Mara river in the Serengeti many will perish but the strongest and fastest
              will make it to the other bank of the river and continue the journey of life.</p>
            <p>In this chasm of A round death is where fast iteration and constant pivoting separates the leaders from
              the followers. In the words of Steve Jobs "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower" the
              best startups win by fast innovation and we all know what happens to the followers.</p>
            <p>The problem facing all of these survivors is that there is not enough "A round ramps" on the other bank
              of the river to receive all these new gazelles. They all think they are destined for greatness. Only the
              top stars will be able to leap over the rest of the herd to safety in the ranks of the few A round
              investors who still have dry powder to fund new startups.</p>
            <p>These survivors are nurtured and supported with A round funding, recruitment and networking and as long
              as they continue to scale on the hockey stick they can quickly join the ranks of legends like Groupon and
              EBay which are the two fastest growth companies in history. If they fail to deliver they will not receive
              the coveted B round and may be even abandoned as less and less capital is available to fund fewer success
              stories at ever higher valuations.</p>
            <p>The "Startup Cambrian Explosion" is everything we experienced in the 2000 bubble but it is 10x bigger in
              absolute numbers. Natural selection now works much faster and in a much more brutal way. New startups die
              within months and their teams scatter to help others bet for the fences with new ideas. It is not
              uncommon to meet twenty something coders who have already been on the teams of five or even ten startups.</p>
            <p>I continue to learn new lessons in this new boom as both a founder and angel investor in more than 50
              companies, I can say that is it harder than ever to figure out which companies will make it and what is a
              good investment at any stage of the game. But it is fascinating game which I love.</p>

            Are we in the beginning of a new bubble</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>Its mid 2011 and many have already forgot that we just had the worst recession since the great
              depression. companies are going public at valuations not seen since 1999. Every downturn brings
              opportunity and allows new ideas to take hold, I believe that despite few abnormalities with specific web
              companies we are in the beginning of another 10 year boom cycle driven by several major trends. Its not a
              bubble but it could easily become one. The following listing represent long term sustainable trends that
              should support long term higher valuations:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Globalization</strong> - China, India, Brazil &amp; Most of Africa are experiencing such fast
                growth that their needs for technology and infrastructure will drive demand in the US and EU for the
                next 10-20 years.</li>
              <li><strong>The Web</strong> - While Web 1.0 was all about infrastructure Web 3.0 is all about services
                which include social and commerce applications. This new boom is long lasting since it engages over 2
                billion people worldwide who have just recently joined the web and are still exploring new ways of
                socializing and transacting. Expect re invention of all the popular services you currently use -
                Amazon, Ebay, Google and others.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy</strong> - the production and distribution of electricity is up for a reinvention.
                Hundreds of billions of dollars were invested in new ways to produce energy and clean tech innovations
                over the past 10 years, finally many of these are of scale and are starting to hit the main markets. I
                expect to see major breakthroughs in the next 10 years that will transform how we generate and consume
                electricity.</li>
              <li><strong>Transportation</strong> - The transition worldwide to electric transport is a major global
                trend that involves many industries and millions of workers. This transformation will help ensure that
                we don't hit another recession any time soon.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With all these macro trends hitting at the same time you can expect many new winners in each category.
              As each of these trends takes hold and involves more and more people around the world greater disruption
              and opportunities will arise, Expect new companies to replace old ways of doing things and create new
              industry leaders. Identifying such opportunities and creating the companies that will transform such
              industries or investing in the leaders is hard and full of land mines. Its always hard to judge timing
              and adoption cycle of new ideas, its also very hard to find the right people and put them together to
              create an industry leader.</p>
            <p>Change is opportunity and there is more change than ever hitting us from all directions.</p>

            Future Energy - Reverse cold fusion</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>With Oil nearing $100 a barrel, there is heightened demand for ideas that can economically and safely
              replace burning oil and coal to generate electrical and locomotive power.</p>
            <p>As we all know from Einstein’s famous E=mc2, there is a lot of energy to be had if you can break down
              mater or move it from one atomic state to another. All recent efforts to create a contained chain
              reaction that generated over unity from fusion have failed but alternatives which include wind and solar
              power are not going to solve the world's needs.</p>
            <p>A controversial idea which has its roots in NY over 100 years ago was raised by Nikola Tesla, he
              proposed extracting electromagnetic energy trapped in the ether. His idea that creating a disturbance in
              the electromagnetic universe around us could result in a standing wave which we can tap into and extract
              more energy than was invested in the disturbance ,was called by many, a violation of the basic rules of
              energy preservation.</p>
            <p>It is amazing to me how conservatism and lack of innovation can keep good ideas under wraps for so long.
              While I am a believer in the preservation of energy, these rules must apply to closed circuit measurement
              and not the energy state of the universe as a whole. Extracting energy in one part of the universe will
              be compensated in another with no overall violation. Zero Point Energy or (ZPE) which is a proven
              fundamental part of Quantum Mechanics Theory (QMT) tells us that while difficult, tapping such energy
              when a disturbance takes place is possible and clearly within the rules. The appearance of matter is due
              to such disturbance of the electromagnetic time space medium.</p>
            <p>A great example of such quantum disturbance is an electric storm or Lightning. It’s an "open circuit
              phenomena" which moves electromagnetic energy from one point to the next many times without touching the
              earth or the ground. While we don't know how to tap it, electrical storms generate several times more
              energy than all human power plants combined.</p>
            <p>Another example is the earth’s magnetic fields which were measured to generate over 500,000,000 Amperes
              of equivalent power and to which we have not been able to tap as well. It is all around us all the time.</p>
            <p>My point is, what we miss is an Energy conversion mechanism not a power source.</p>
            <p>One idea I am working on is to create a self sustained electromagnetic flux inside matter and then tap
              such flux to generate electrical power. Many experiments have been made over the years but they were not
              based on scientific formulations that broke new grounds, rather they relied on experimentation with
              electromagnetism to try and discover new ways to create energy.</p>
            <p>If matter can be fused to create heavier elements, matter can be un-fused to create lighter elements and
              in the process we can extract the E part of Einstein's equation. It is easy to do so with unstable
              radioactive materials but try to do it with Copper or Lead.</p>
            <p>The key is to do so in a contained and controllable fashion that balances the chain reaction with
              extraction and do it without the need to use high temperatures and Plasma containing magnetic fields.</p>

            When you don't know what you don't know</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>We have recently witnessed several Web 2.0 companies invent new user mediums and gather over 100m users
              in a few years. Until their launch, no one thought they were necessary. This process has proven that the
              web is just beginning its transformation of the world as we know it. None of these company founders knew
              ahead of time what they were building or that their applications would be so successful with so many
              users. They did not think of monetization or cash flow. Their lack of knowledge about what needs to be
              there to make it a good business allowed them to make their venture a smashing success.</p>
            <p>So what do we know about the web? Well nothing, it is so fundamentally changing what is possible and how
              things will be done in the future that prior business knowledge is an obstacle not a benefit. We really
              don't know what we don't know.</p>
            <p>Berkeley Rice was quoted saying "visionary people are visionary partly because of the very great many
              things they don't see". That has never been truer than with the new wave of web applications. All these
              old economy barriers we are taking for granted as part of life, melt like butter in the wake of this
              massive heat wave that is expanding at the speed of light from the super nova called the Internet. The
              speed of development and deployment is so fast that it is exceeding the ability of most of us to absorb
              and digest and then implement in our daily lives. The gap between the web life and the normal life is
              growing so fast that a new culture exists out there to which most of us don't belong. The price to pay
              for admission is spending at least 10 hours a day tracking everyone else to ensure you are still in the
              race. In this world if you are not creating content you don't belong and what matters more than money is
              your recognition by your peer group.</p>
            <p>None of the traditional global businesses feel endangered by this new culture but there is a fundamental
              decoupling of lifestyle and commerce taking place between the Web 2.0 crowd and the rest of the economy.
              As the number of these global web users has reached a critical point we will start seeing commercial
              ventures which owe their entire existence to their popularity and their connection to the future mass
              crowds of web 2.0 users. It would be as difficult to unseat these new brand giants as it is impossible to
              imagine that Coca Cola or Nike can loose their dominating lead today. But then if we knew it, it would
              not happen.</p>

            Globalization and its impact on the US economy and investments worldwide</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>"Think globally, act locally". This philosophy is becoming less and less possible in a world where not
              only every product but every service has become a commodity. This rapid shift is slowly forcing the US
              economy, traditionally the largest in the world to adjust to a new world order.</p>
            <p>Globalization is certainly not a new phenomenon but its impact on the world economy has accelerated to
              the point where global brands and low cost producers are increasingly dividing the spending dollars of
              the world's consumers. We no longer care that products are made in China or Vietnam nor do we care if any
              of their components or intellectual property was created in the US.</p>
            <p>To its credit, the United States has been transforming itself into a services economy and has
              successfully managed to retrain over 50 million workers to find new service jobs. By innovating and
              leading the technology revolution the US continued to create value and expand the standard of living.
              However, a dramatic change over the last three years has put the US at a cross roads. On one side
              security and protectionism have caused the US borders to partially close to top talent and to foreign
              made goods due to world events while on the other side the technological gap between the US and the new
              Asian economies has steadily been shrinking. As the largest economy in the world the US can wait and do
              nothing or even protect our lifestyle with tariffs and restrictions. History teaches us though that even
              the largest world power that closes itself off from the world around them out of arrogance will quickly
              lose their dominance and more importantly the talent that made them succeed in the first place. The
              current trickle of talent going back to India and China will become a flood unless we change our policy
              and accept the new world order in which being an aging service economy is not a sustainable competitive
              advantage.</p>
            <p>The telecom industry is a striking example of this phenomenon. After the 1996 US telecom deregulation
              the FCC and the State Department began pressing the WTO (World Trade Organization) member nations to
              lower international telephone rates and deregulate their telecom monopolies. This single act created a
              second wave of globalization - the commoditization of services.</p>
            <p>With a VOIP call to Bombay costing the same as a local call to New York the obstacle that kept many of
              these developing nations from competing for services in the US &amp; Europe was eliminated. More and more of
              the 100 million US workforces were forced to compete against almost one billion Indian, English speaking
              workers who make less than $100 a month. It is my position that the only way the U.S. economy can survive
              in such an environment is to transform ourselves again by creating new markets with new products and
              services that will continue to attract the world's best talent to come and live in the USA. This painful
              process will take 5-10 years and will eliminate 5-10 million low skill service jobs in countries around
              the world.</p>
            <p>How to transform ourselves is obviously the BIG question. Successful solutions and new markets reveal
              themselves only through the natural selection of trial and error and of course, risk capital. Right now,
              the US has global dominance in this area but that is about to change. As skilled US entrepreneurs go back
              to China and India and tap a skilled workplace hungry to succeed in this new globalized workforce, it
              will become more and more difficult for US companies to maintain their dominance.</p>
            <p>The increasing ease of being able to move capital around the world freely and to pluck talent from so
              many different regions will make it possible to create these new global businesses with relatively small
              investments with very high growth rates which of course is the dream of any venture capitalist.</p>
            <p>While most of the media and the investment community is focused on China's manufacturing miracle, this
              century also belongs to India. As the world’s largest English speaking nation and the world’s largest
              democracy it is bound to outpace China as it produces an increased number of components for the
              globalized service economy with higher margins and sustainable competitive advantages that China may not
              have.</p>
            <p>Though it may take thirty years, it is my prediction that India will eventually take over as the world's
              largest economic driver. What should the US try to do in that period of time? My suggestion is to keep
              innovating and invest in India so that as a country, we can share the in the value and the profits which
              will be created there in the next decade.</p>

            The age of intelligent software</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body" style="display: none;">
            <p>In the eighties and nineties we saw standardization and commoditization of hardware, prices have tumbled
              and we got to buy more of everything more often.</p>
            <p>The first half of the 21 century will be dominated by the commoditization of software, driven by early
              effort such as Java and Linux a new breed of open interoperable language for the internet will emerge, it
              will incorporate XML, Semantic Web, web services and other initiatives which will for the first time
              allow computers to dynamically transact with each other and allow logic and meaning to process the
              content that was amassed on the internet in the past twenty years.</p>
            <p>The significance of this transformation will only emerge as companies and individuals come to depend on
              such functionality in their daily lives just as we depend on our email and cell phones today. Dynamic and
              seamless Internet commerce will explode and will forever replace expensive and proprietary traditional
              software we use today.</p>
            <p>These new opportunities, emerging from this transformation will create new industry giants which will
              lead the second wave of the internet boom. All of this innovation will not be possible if the
              infrastructure built in the past decade did not secure the US as the country with the lowest
              communication costs in the world.</p>
            <p>The recent telecom debacle which has wiped $600b of investments and over 2 trillion dollars of equity
              value is the foundation for the US service economy of the 21 century. America has invested billions in
              its optical highways which guarantee a long supply of low cost digital oxygen to the internet and its
              users. </p>

            Management of networks Feb. 2000</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>The management of networks and information flows is going to be far more important and valuable than
              owning the networks themselves.</p>
            <p>The past 50 years of computing and telecommunications have been dedicated to the development of core
              technologies, and to the build-up of infrastructure. The dawn of the Digital Age has led to an
              overwhelming increase in the availability of information, both current information and the digitization
              of data from the past 20 centuries, as well as the convergence of multiple information delivery networks.</p>
            <p>While the build-out of infrastructure will continue the management of transport mediums and the
              management of information delivery will become more important than the network itself.</p>
            <p>Entirely new value chains will be created in the next 20 years that will dwarf the Yahoos and Cisco's of
              today, they will enable managed peer-to-peer transactions via wire and wireless communications to be as
              seamlessly integrated into our daily lives as electricity is now part of everything we do.</p>
            <p>My focus is to create management solutions for these new networks and to position the companies offering
              these solutions in the center of the new value chains. </p>

      <h5><a name="failed">Failed Ventures</a></h5>

      <p>As a maverick investor and entrepreneur, Alex has recorded many failures along with his successes, gleaning
        more valuable lessons from the former. Alex assesses that there are many reasons that appropriated his
        failures, many an underestimation of the time and money needed to implement the projects, as well as the level
        of commitment and abilities of the companies’ management.</p>
      <p>According to him, the hardest part thing with losses is learning to when to cut them off and admit to
        mistakes. It all came full circle when the sage advice, "A focused mind is one of the most powerful forces in
        the universe" came to Alex through a fortune cookie while at a local eatery in Manhattan. He realized that some
        of his lessons took 20 years to learn.</p>

      <h6>Alex’s own firms, 2008</h6>
      <p>As the recession hit, Alex’s decision to leverage two of his ventures with debt turned disastrous as his
        lenders refused to be patient. He lost all his equity in one of the ventures as the other got refinanced.</p>
      <p>His takeaway from that event was to never put debt into early stage growth companies.</p>

      <h6>The US Housing Market, 2006</h6>
      <p>Alex had a good intuition prior to the housing market collapse and finally decided to bet against it by
        shorting the home builders. He lost money in all of 2006 as the housing market continued to do well at that
        time, and eventually he decided to cut his losses early in 2007.</p>
      <p>He then went to watch home builders lose over 70% of their value in the following twelve months. He had failed
        to make the connection between the home builders’ collapse to the collapse of the banking and financial system
        which followed.</p>
      <p>The lesson he learnt was to stick to his guts, especially when one has a track record of being right.</p>

      <h6>Twitter, 2004</h6>
      <p>Alex knew there was going to be a better way to publish new information on the internet so he wrote a patent
        for publishing information in real-time to a list of followers.</p>
      <p>At the same time, he had also started working on GroundLink and had to make a choice between the two ventures.
        He chose GroundLink while the other idea turned into what came to be known as Twitter.</p>

      <img src="../images/novocure.gif">
      <h6><a href="http://www.novocure.com/">Novacure</a>, 2004</h6>
      <p>Alex had the opportunity to invest in this revolutionary cancer treatment process but decided it was too
        revolutionary.</p>

      <img name="Skype" src="../images/skype-logo.gif">
      <h6><a href="https://www.skype.com/intl/en/home">Skype</a>, 2002</h6>
      <p>Alex had received a call from a VC asking about his opinion on a small startup doing a VOIP product. Since he
        knew the space too well, he decided the prospects for the firm were not good and passed on it.</p>

      <img name="ICG" src="../images/icg.gif">
      <h6><a href="http://www.icg.com/about/">ICG, 1999</a></h6>
      <p>Alex was the seed investor in Arbinet at the time and he received an invitation to purchase pre-IPO equity for
        ICG. However, he wired the money too late to participate and ICG stock subsequently soared from $7 to $212 in
        six months.</p>

      <img name="Google" src="../images/google.gif">
      <h6><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, 1998</h6>
      <p>Alex was introduced to Sergey Brin by Ester Dyson, and after listening to his presentation of ‘how a
        link-based algorithm could provide better search results,’ he regrettably said, "Who needs another search
        engine? We have AltaVista!"</p>

      <h6>Tradeum, 1998</h6>
      <p>Alex was contracted to buy software at this firm. He even went on to negotiate the equity upside and
        co-investment possibilities but he switched his mind at the last minute and the firm went on to be sold for
        $1.2 billion the next year.</p>

      <img name="ICQ" src="../images/icq.gif">
      <h6><a href="https://www.icq.com/en">ICQ</a>, 1996</h6>
      <p>Yosi Vardi offered Alex equity in his company as barter for bandwidth from Arbinet but he declined the
        exchange and ICQ went on to sell to AOL for $450 million a mere eight months later.</p>

      <img src="../images/VocalTech.gif">
      <h6><a href="http://www.vocaltec.com/">Vocaltech</a></h6>
      <p>Alex had the opportunity to invest in the company twice before their IPO but passed on the opportunity both
        times.</p>

      <p>Following is a list of short descriptions of topics Alex has been working on over the years:</p>

        <li class="active">
          <div class="collapsible-header truncate active"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i> Discovery (2011)</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body" style="display: block;">
            <p>“The process of discovering something new is extremely unique and satisfying. We get great joy learning
              new things but discovering something you think no one knows has extreme exhilaration and such strong and
              unique feeling that after you have experienced it once you are willing to go to the end of the world to
              experience it again. It’s hard to explain why it is so and I am sure this is truer for some than for
              others but it’s a special feeling that for me will always count among the best moments of my entire life.</p>
            <p> was lucky enough to have experienced these moments several times as I explored new industries and
              ideas. Many times, even before such ideas were verified as correct or checked for prior art or other
              similar discoveries my gut already knew them to be so and I knew I was facing the truth, I got to see
              gods work in pure and simple formulas or process of how something works or behaves.</p>
            <p>When you read about some of the greatest discoverers of all times and their passion and dedication to
              solve a single riddle it’s hard not to admire such man and women of science and want to be one of them.
              Most of us think that we are not capable of such discoveries or that the ideas we have can’t be correct
              but when an idea comes to us in the middle of the night or when facing something new we mostly let such
              moments of discovery pass us by. We all have the skill but we don't all have the patience or the
              attention it requires and we need to develop these skills to explore and discover.</p>
            <p>When I give talks I often hear that most of what was there to be discovered was already discovered, I
              can assure you that this is not correct. We double our knowledge faster than ever before which means we
              discover and invest faster than ever before. all it takes to recognize such change is to watch a
              10-year-old movie and see how far we have come in such a short time.”</p>

          <div class="collapsible-header truncate"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i> DNA Evolution (2004)</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>“It is a proven fact that both simple one cell and multi-cell creatures gain knowledge and new ideas
              from one another by exchanging DNA. They also adopt DNA from the food they eat. Over time as species
              evolved and became more complicated they had less to gain from other species and began to only exchange
              within their own hierarchy, eventually narrowing the exchange even further to sub species with higher
              intelligence. To date the key difficulty in the DNA evolution remains to be how to transfer the
              fundamental memories and patterns each creature’s genes has created and perfected to defend themselves to
              the next generation for the evolution process to perpetuate itself.</p>
            <p>Species of higher intelligence use Protein-based stored procedures in addition to DNA-based instincts
              which are essentially stored pre-programmed patterns encapsulated in different levels of the brain that
              transfer basic knowledge from one generation to the next. Mitochondrion DNA, a symbiotic companion of
              humans, generating cells from the dawn of civilization is doing the same thing but in its own separate
              evolutionary world by transferring itself from one generation to the next via the female gender without
              sex and based strictly on mutations generated by a single strain of family heritage.”</p>

          <div class="collapsible-header truncate"><i class="material-icons">expand_more</i> Our brain and invention -
            (2003)</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>“The human brain’s single most important function is to predict the immediate next event through one of
              our six senses. When a person reads something, or listens to someone, their brain is instinctively making
              a prediction of what the idea or conversation is going to be about. If what is then heard or seen is not
              what the brain had predicted the brain is surprised and instantly works to rationalize or accept the new
              input. The filter we apply at this critical step is the differentiating factor between creative people
              and those who just follow others. Most people, instead of accepting the new input, will work harder not
              to diverge from the original idea, immediately reverting to the idea or topic presented, thereby
              preventing their brain to continue to predict other new outcomes or solutions. Should the person allow
              their brain to continue to accept the new information and put aside what was predicted, new solutions and
              ideas emerge.</p>
            <p>The brain will then test such ideas against what it believes is possible to make sure it observes the
              variety of rules and restrictions the brain currently possesses. These new ideas are then added to the
              pool of possible predictions for future scenarios enabling a person to have a greater source of possible
              outcomes.</p>
            <p>Most people do not do anything with such inventions or unique predictions and will not let their brains
              go the distance and truly invent new things. The few that do venture that far do not have the confidence
              to believe that they may be on to something completely new. Most the remaining people do not believe they
              are the first ones to think of the idea and just let it fade away after a few minutes. A small subset of
              mostly determined, self-confident people are hit by the invention bug and do not let such thoughts die
              until they find a way to implement them or test them out.</p>
            <p>Invention is very different from discovery. The discovery process involves mostly gathering enough facts
              or using new tools to explain or observe something no one has seen before such as with the discovery of
              the elements in the periodic table or discovering the genome. Invention requires the highest level of
              cortex based thinking and is only effective if you create something very different from anything that
              already exists. Our brains are not programmed to do that because we routinely train them to do the same
              tasks again and again and again.”</p>

          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>“The invention of the telegraph heralded the world’s first form of digital communications, surpassing
              the Morse code which consisted of only two type of signals, 0 and 1. With the additional development of
              the microphone and speakers as well as switching systems, the network transitioned to analog
              communications until the semiconductor and software caught up with it in the late 1970s and the networks
              started to digitize. Today almost all communications systems are digital but our input is still analog
              and will stay so for quite a while. The slow progress made in creating digital interfaces between the
              brain and our computer input sources is the main stumbling block to move computing to the next level.”</p>

            DNA communication to Engineered DNA (1997)</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>“For the past 4 billion years transferring information from one living cell to another was done via
              genetic mitosis which included intentional and unintentional changes in the genes. Over the past 3000
              years, humans evolved to transfer information verbally as well as through the written word, thus
              shortening the cycle dramatically. More recently digital communications have allowed us the ability to
              instantly transfer information to any point in the globe. Each step in this evolutionary process was a
              ten-fold improvement on the previous generations’ best solution and was adopted rapidly. Today we are the
              first generation to be smart and knowledgeable enough to redesign and improve our DNA based formulation
              and to have computers that are powerful enough to simulate the results of such improvements. This
              advanced development will eventually lead to an environment where organic and electronic systems merge,
              taking advantage of the strength of each system and moving our existence for the first time to a
              bio-electric state, breaking mental and intellectual barriers and elevating mankind’s abilities to new
              levels.”</p>

      <h5>THOMAS JEFFERSON ON PATENTS</h5>
      <p>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of
        the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to
        himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver
        cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every
        other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without
        lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.</p>
      <p>That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of
        man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when
        she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the
        air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
        appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.</p>
      <p>Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue
        ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the
        society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that
        England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to
        the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special
        and personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more
        embarrassment than advantage to society; and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of
        invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.</p>
